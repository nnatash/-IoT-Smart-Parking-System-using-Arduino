Smart Parking System
An IoT-based parking management prototype built with Arduino UNO, IR proximity sensors, a servo motor, and an LCD I2C display. The system detects vehicle entry and exit, controls an automated gate, and updates available parking slots in real time. Designed to reduce congestion, improve parking efficiency, and enhance user convenience by displaying slot availability before entry.

Technologies & Components: Arduino UNO, IR Proximity Sensors, Servo Motor, LCD I2C, C++ (Arduino IDE)

Key Features:
Real-time parking slot detection using IR sensors
Automated gate control with servo motor
Live slot count display on LCD I2C
Reduces search time and fuel consumption
